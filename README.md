## About Me

I am a researcher working at the intersection of physics-based modelling and artificial intelligence for weather and energy systems. My work focuses on hybrid NWP–deep learning models, uncertainty quantification, and multi-horizon spatiotemporal forecasting.

Currently working on:
- Hybrid Physics–AI models for geophysical forecasting
- Energy system optimization for Net Zero pathways
- Probabilistic and deterministic forecasting frameworks
